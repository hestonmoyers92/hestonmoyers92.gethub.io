        <h1>The Reason Behind my company.</h1>
        <p id="enlarge">My name is Heston Moyers and I have been married to my beautiful wife Ashley for almost 4 years. We have an amazing 2 year old that has been the best thing that has happened to us. Here is a picture of my little family. <br>
            <img src="../style/family.jpg" alt="family">
            <br>When me and my wife got married we decided to go to ikea and get some new furniture with the money we received from our wedding. This was a huge mistake. the furniture did not last long at all and we were faced with a situation where we could not afford to buy new furniture. as time went by when livng with old broken furniture i decided to take action into my own hands and instead of paying a fortune for furniture that wil actally work i decided to look on craigslist for old furniture that was strong and sturdy and refinished it. here is a picture of the verry first piece of furniture that i refinished. <br>
            <img src="../style/refinish.jpg" alt="refinish">
            <br>
            Once I refinished that piece of furniture I started planning to build some furniture of my own. So gradually I started collecting the tools that i needed to make the furniture and as time went on I pretty much had all the furniture in my house hand made for a fraction of the cost. At that time my wife mentioned why donâ€™t you make furniture and sell it to make a little extra money so that is how I started building furniture. Below are a few of the pieces of furniture that I have built.<br>
