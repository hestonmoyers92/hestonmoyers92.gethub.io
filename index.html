<p>I can build any furniture that you can think of. Anything from a bed	that is	lined with fabric to a solid wood book shelf. I	have built coffee tables benches book shelfs entertainment centers kitchen tables and much more. I have been building furniture with my dad since I was in the 8th grade and it just comes naturally to me. All the furniture that I build is reinforced with screws not nails. Although nails are faster screws give it the durability that I guarantee.any of the furnature that i build can be changed in any way</p>
